# MSS Resources

This is a collection of resources that might prove useful for people interested in knowledge and skills related to Managed Security Services (MSS). 

The collection consists of:

* **vendorCertifications.md** - A list of relevant certifications from vendors who supply equipment and software for MSS.
* **nonVendorCertifications.md** - A list of relevant certifications from organisations who aren't vendors.

For the most part, non-MSS cybersecurity courses, vendors, certifications etc. have not been included.

Please follow the [contribution guidelines](/howToContribute.md) for corrections or contributions.
