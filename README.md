This is a collection of resources that might prove useful for people interested in knowledge and skills related to Managed Security Services (MSS). 

The collection consists of:

* **[vendorCertifications.md](vendorCertifications.md)** - A list of relevant certifications from vendors who supply equipment and software for MSS.
* **[nonVendorCertifications.md](nonVendorCertifications.md)** - A list of relevant certifications from organisations who aren't vendors.
* **[courseProviders.md](courseProviders.md)** - A list of online course providers with material relevant to MSS.
* **[resources.md](resources.md)** - A list of courses that might be suitable for MSS team members.

For the most part, non-MSS cybersecurity courses, vendors, certifications etc. have not been included.
