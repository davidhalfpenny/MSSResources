## Udemy

<details>
  <summary>View Details</summary>

[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) is an online course platform that claims to have the world's largest selection of courses. Much of the focus seems to be on technology, though there are courses in photography, music, design etc.

Udemy courses are "crowd sourced" in that anyone can create a course on Udemy. Though Udemy assists instructors in the creation of courses, the quality of these courses is quite variable, as is the course pricing. Courses are frequently/regularly/continually discounted. If a course is noted at a "high" price, waiting and revisiting the course, or visiting the course through a VPN or in incognito mode may trigger a drastic price reduction (e.g. a course "normally" at $204.99 is reduced to $14.99 for a limited time). Compared to some other training, even the high price version of a course may be cheap. 

Team (5-20 people) and enterprise pricing is available.

For popular topics, technologies, and certifications, a huge number of courses exists. Where specific courses are listed, they fall into two categories:

1. They have a 4 or more star rating and more than 100 reviewers. [Note: individual courses that fit this criteria are listed only if there are a manageable few. Some topics, technologies, and certifications have many courses with 4 or more star ratings and thousands of reviewers].
2. They have been recommended by colleagues (these will be identified as such).

This doesn't imply general endorsement of particular courses and may discriminate against newer or more esoteric courses.
