First of all I want to state that this course is still in Progress. I will be adding on to this course beyond the RIP video. So hang in there.This is a course that starts off with some theory and then flows right in some fun. Configuring interfaces, setting up zones, filter routes, and setting up routing protocols. All of this is done on the Juniper command line. You are about to walk into a world which Juniper is no stranger to providing a powerful operating system that make their devices provide granular or simple tasks.
By the time you are finished with this course, you will have the skills to be comfortable on JUNOS. But this does not happen over night. It takes practice and you need to spend the time practicing. I have taken the time to provide you with a course that helps you get familiar with the command line.
I will be using real Juniper equipment with my lectures and there is a lots of time spent on the command line. That is correct, you will be seeing a lot of configurations. Lets face it, that is why you are here. You will learn how to configure IP addresses, set up zones, allow traffic into and between zones, static routing, routing protocols, route filtering, and so on.
You can take for granted that you will find this course relaxing and a joy to follow. There is some boring things in the beginning, but when we start configuring, it just keeps going and going. Juniper is usually a device that others start with after having experience with other networking vendors. So you will need the basic skills in Network Fundamentals, IP addressing, TCP/IP, OSI Model, and Basic Communicated between two host.
This is a course that is designed for one purpose....... To leave the course and gain the ability to configure a Juniper device. That is my goal and that is the mission of this course.

This course is intended for individuals who already possess a good amount of general IT knowledge, so be sure to read the list of prerequisites before you get started. Over the span of the course, we will dive into the nature of hacking at the hardware level. This is how virtually all vulnerabilities were discovered — by individuals combing through source code or reverse engineering binaries. This is what sets this course apart from the many others like it. In this course, you will learn how the vulnerabilities that are readily available in frameworks like Metasploit, BeEF, SET, and others are found, so that you will be able to deconstruct a program instead of just trying to figure out how to use something other people wrote! We’ll also cover subjects such as anonymity online and tackle the common misconception that VPN services guarantee anonymity. You’ll learn how to set up and operate your own anonymizing services — that way you can trust them more! In the Social Engineering section of the course, you will learn how to think like a hacker. This is extremely important, as your behavior and thought process determine whether you are an easy target for attacks or a serious cybersecurity specialist no one wants to mess with.

This foundational CBT Nuggets Soft Skills prepares learners to navigate the messy and complex interconnected world of relationships and business interactions with expertise, respect and confidence.

A lot of people tend to dismiss soft skills training as frivolous or touchy-feely. That tendency probably comes from the idea that no one likes to think that they don't already know how to do things like write clearly, speak well, solve problems, manage time, or interact with team members more. These things seem so commonplace and simple that the idea of getting training in them can be like admitting you missed that day in kindergarten. But the people who think so are mistaken: not only is soft skills training crucial for the majority of the workforce, but it's no fault of your own if you do need it. Working alongside others and doing it well requires a highly intentional mindset - with this training, you'll learn it and how to apply it to make your workcenter not just more pleasant to work in, but more effective and profitable.

After finishing this CBT Nuggets training, you'll know how to navigate the messy and complex interconnected world of relationships and business interactions with expertise, respect and confidence.

For anyone who manages soft skills training, this CBT Nuggets training can be used to onboard new new IT professionals, curated into individual or team training plans, or as a CBT Nuggets reference resource.

We continue to underestimate the tenacity of our adversaries! Organizations are investing a significant amount of time and financial and human resources trying to combat cyber threats and prevent cyber attacks, but despite this tremendous effort organizations are still getting compromised. The traditional perimeter-focused, prevention-dominant approach to security architecture has failed to prevent intrusions. No network is impenetrable, a reality that business executives and security professionals alike have to accept. Prevention is crucial, and we can't lose sight of it as the primary goal. However, a new proactive approach to security is needed to enhance the capabilities of organizations to detect threats that will inevitably slip through their defenses. SEC511: Continuous Monitoring and Security Operations will teach you how to strengthen your skills to undertake that proactive approach.

Keeping up with advanced cyber threats and sifting through the insurmountable number of alerts available to security analysts is not sustainable without leveling up your security analysis skills to keep pace with modern security operations. Developing the skills necessary for a security analyst to properly detect and triage advanced attacker intrusion tactics and techniques requires experience and the use of advanced detection capabilities. Neither of which are easily obtained. This path you will develop the skills and knowledge required to not only understand how a multitude of advanced attacker techniques are performed, but also what they look like in a realistic environment, and how to identify them as part of your security analyst operations. The courses in this path cover the objectives of the CSWF Cyber Defense Analyst role, and the attacks detected are reflective of threat actor techniques found in the Mitre ATT&CK framework.
